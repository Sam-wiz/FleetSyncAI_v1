## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB**: The platform uses MongoDB for data storage. Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running, either locally or through a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas.
- **Docker**: Install Docker to run the AI agents in a containerized environment. You can download Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sam-wiz/FleetSyncAI_v1.git
    cd FleetSyncAI_v1
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure your environment variables.

4. **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. **Build and Run the Docker Container**:

    The Docker container is used to run the AI agents that power the platformâ€™s decision-making processes.

    - **Build the Docker image**:

      ```bash
      docker-compose up --build
      ```

6. **Access the platform**:

    The platform will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Database Setup

Make sure your MongoDB instance is running and that the connection string is correctly set in your `.env` file. Mongoose will handle the connection to the database.

### API Integration

The platform integrates with OpenAI's API to optimize transport routes and other logistics tasks. Ensure you have an API key from OpenAI and add it to your `.env` file.

## Usage

1. **Booking a Truck**: Users can book a truck through the platform by providing necessary details such as origin, destination, and cargo type. The AI agent will handle the rest, including selecting the best truck and route.
  
2. **Fleet Management**: The AI-powered fleet manager monitors and manages the entire fleet, making real-time decisions to optimize operations.

3. **Warehouse Management**: The AI-driven warehouse manager ensures that inventory is tracked accurately, and orders are fulfilled efficiently.
